## Horse Race
On this project we had to create a horse race using POO. It can scale for more horses but this one is for three horses. When you start the race, on every iteration the 3 horses make a random amount of steps. The race is over when the last horse reach to the pre-defined maximum amount of steps.

## Description
On this project we went further on POO on typescript and testing. 

## Installation

Download or clone the repository and install the packages using the command: npm install

## Usage

Run the "cours_animal" file to start the race
